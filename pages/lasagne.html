        <li>50 g (2oz) butter</li>
        <li>50 g (2oz) plain flour</li>
        <li>600 ml whole milk</li>
        <li>about 9 sheets dried egg lasagne (enough for 3 layers of pasta)</li>
        <li>100 g (3 ½oz) Parmesan, grated</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Gently heat the oil in a large frying pan with a lid. Fry the onion with a pinch of salt, 
            covered, for 10min, until softened, stirring halfway through. Increase heat slightly; 
            add celery and carrot and cook, covered, for 10min until softened. Add garlic, tomato purée
             and oregano; cook for 1min.</li></p>
        <p><li>Season mince, break up and add to the pan, stirring until evenly browned.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add the wine, increase heat and reduce by half. Pour in chopped  tomatoes. Rinse tin out 
            with hot beef stock and add to the pan. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1hr, stirring 
            occasionally. Remove the lid for a final 30min to reduce the sauce.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat oven to 180°C (160°C fan) mark 4. Lightly bruise garlic and bay leaf.</li></p> 
        <p><li>For the béchamel, melt the butter in a large, non-stick pan, and then add flour, stirring 
            with a wooden spoon to make a smooth, thick paste. Cook, stirring, for 2min. Remove from 
            heat and gradually whisk in milk until smooth. </li></p> 
        <p><li>Add garlic and bay leaf. Return to heat, bring to boil and simmer, stirring, for about 5min until sauce has thickened and coats 
            the back of the spoon. Off the heat, remove garlic and bay leaf and set aside.</li>  </p>  
        <p><li>In a large pan of salted, boiling water, cook pasta for 1min in batches to  avoid sticking. 
            Set aside to dry on an oiled plate.</li></p>
            <p><li>Spread a third of the meat over the base of a 1.6 litre (2¾ pint) baking dish 
            about 25.5 x 25.5cm (10 x 10in). Spoon over a quarter of the béchamel, sprinkle with 
            2tbsp Parmesan and place 3 sheets of pasta over in a single layer.</li></p>
        <p><li>Repeat twice. Top with the rest of the béchamel, then sprinkle over remaining cheese. 
            Season with finely ground black pepper. Bake for 35min, until golden.</li></p> 
    </ol>
